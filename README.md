# CHOW - an open-source GDE (Gnarly Distortion Effect) 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/CHOW.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jatinchowdhury18/CHOW)

CHOW is a digital distortion effect discovered almost entirely by accident. While the waveform output of CHOW most closely resembles that of a half-wave rectifier, the output is actually quite listenable (though heavily distorted). I've found the effect quite useful for mixing guitars, drums, even vocals when a heavily degraded sound is desired. Feel free to build and use for your own enjoyment! (Be aware that to build the VST version, you must have your own copy of the vst2 sdk)

CHOW is currently available in the following formats:
  - VST
  - VST3
  - AU
  - Standalone plugin
